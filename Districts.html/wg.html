        <p>During the Madras Presidency in 1823, the District of Rajahmundry was created.[10] It was reorganised in 1859 and bifurcated into the Godavari and Krishna districts. During British rule, Rajahmundry was the headquarters of Godavari district, which was further bifurcated into the East Godavari and West Godavari districts in 1925.[11] When the Godavari district was divided, Kakinada became the headquarters of East Godavari and Eluru became the headquarters of West Godavari. After the 4 April 2022 bifurcation for a separate Eluru district, Bhimavaram became the new headquarters of the West Godavari district.</p>

The Polavaram Project irrigation system is expected to become another tourist attraction for the district.</P>
